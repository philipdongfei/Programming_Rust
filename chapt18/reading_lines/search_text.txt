Note that a **File** is not automatically buffered. **File** implements
**Read** but not **BufRead**. However, it's easy to create a buffered
reader for a **File**, or any other unbuffereD reader. **BufReader::new(reader)**
does this. (To set the size of the buffer, use **BufReader::with_capacity(size, reader)**.)
